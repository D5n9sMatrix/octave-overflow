# after sucking on a mango i thought to myself that you have to be
# someone clueless i prefer math to obscure the meaning of things
# like an apple this is the dark side of math that reveals sin but
# this is a calculus that has two x and y components . These two
# are actually calculations from the GNU Octave grades I love
# these calculations as complexes of my units but I say that
# I don't live only on complexes but also on inferiority's for
# the case of personal duality which is another dark side of
# mathematics that refers to the duality of productions such
# as the artist Archimedes who created several calculations
# on mathematics this would be a duality but of course I know
# he is much better than me but I cannot give up studying mathematics.
